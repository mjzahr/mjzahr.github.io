  abstract = {This report discusses the creation, improvement, and application of a web-based seismic risk map tool developed at the USGS in Golden, CO.
Reinforced concrete buildings built in the western United States prior to implementation of modern seismic code standards in 1976 typically behave in a non- ductile manner under seismic loading, which can lead to catastrophic failure. The high degree of seismic hazard in the western United States makes retrofitting such non-ductile concrete buildings a necessity. Due to the associated cost and time, it is virtually impossible to exhaustively mitigate the seismic risk created by these older concrete buildings. This has motivated the development and improvement of a web-based seismic risk map tool as a way to prioritize retrofits. This tool provides a means to quickly identify the regions of the US where non-ductile concrete buildings are at a high risk of failure. Furthermore, with an inventory of non-ductile concrete buildings for a particular area, the buildings at the highest risk in that area can be pinpointed for seismic retrofit.},
