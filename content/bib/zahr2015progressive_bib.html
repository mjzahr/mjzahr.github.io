  abstract = {An adaptive approach to using reduced-order models (ROMs) as surrogates in partial differential equations (PDE)-constrained optimization is introduced that breaks the traditional offline-online framework of model order reduction. A sequence of optimization problems constrained by a given ROM is defined with the goal of converging to the solution of a given PDE-constrained optimization problem. For each reduced optimization problem, the constraining ROM is trained from sampling the high-dimensional model (HDM) at the solution of some of the previous problems in the sequence. The reduced optimization problems are equipped with a nonlinear trust-region based on a residual error indicator to keep the optimization trajectory in a region of the parameter space where the ROM is accurate. A technique for incorporating sensitivities into a reduced-order basis is also presented, along with a methodology for computing sensitivities of the ROM that minimizes the distance to the corresponding HDM sensitivity, in a suitable norm.

The proposed reduced optimization framework is applied to subsonic aerodynamic shape optimization and shown to reduce the number of queries to the HDM by a factor of 4-5, compared with the optimization problem solved using only the HDM, with errors in the optimal solution far less than 0.1\%.},
