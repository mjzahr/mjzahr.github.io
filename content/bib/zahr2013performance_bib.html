  abstract = {In this work, we investigate numerical solvers and time integrators for the system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) arising from the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DG-FEM) semi-discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations to explore potential speedup opportunities. DG-FEMs have many desirable properties such as sta- bility, high-order accuracy, and ability to handle complex geometries. However, they are notorious for their high computational cost and storage. In this document, our problems are spatially discretized with DG-FEM, temporally discretized with various implicit ODE solvers, and the nonlinear systems are solved using a Newton-GMRES method [1,2]. We study the effects of varying several parameters, including the ODE solver, predictors for Newton's method, GMRES tolerance, and Jacobian recycling. We show that by properly choosing these parameters, speedup factors of between 5 and 14 can be achieved over non- optimal choices. The numerical experiments are performed on two model flow problems: An Euler vortex and the viscous flow over a 2D NACA wing at a high angle of attack.},
