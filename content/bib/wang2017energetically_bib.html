  abstract = {This work introduces a fully discrete, high-order numerical framework for solving PDE- constrained optimization problems using gradient-based methods in the case where one or more of the optimization parameters affects the time domain; a canonical example being optimization of the frequency of a flapping wing. In a fully discrete setting, this effective parametrization of the time domain leads to a parametrization of the time discretization, e.g., to maintain a fixed number of timesteps per period, the timestep size is parameter- dependent. Gradients of quantities of interest in this work are computed using the adjoint method, which must take into account the parametric dependence of the time discretiza- tion. As this work considers energetically optimal flight, a globally high-order discretization of conservation laws on deforming domains is employed: an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation maps the conservation law to a fixed reference domain and a high-order dis- continuous Galerkin method and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method are used for the spatial and temporal discretizations. This framework is applied to study energetically optimal flapping subject to a minimum required thrust, including frequency and pitch- ing/heaving trajectories as optimization parameters. This marks a distinct departure from other adjoint-based approaches to optimal flapping that fix the frequency.
