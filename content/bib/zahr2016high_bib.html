  abstract = {The fully discrete adjoint method, corresponding to a globally high-order accurate dis- cretization of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on deforming domains, is intro- duced. A mapping-based Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian description transforms the gov- erning equations to a fixed reference domain. A high-order discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal discretization are employed to obtain the globally high-order discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Relevant quantities of interest, to be used as the objective function in aerodynamic trajectory op- timization problems, are discretized in a solver-consistent manner. Gradients of these quantities of interest are computed via the adjoint method and verified against a second- order finite difference approximation. The proposed fully discrete adjoint method is coupled with state-of-the-art, gradient-based numerical optimization software to solve aerodynamic trajectory optimization problems. The first example is an inverse design problem with a known, global optimum that the solver is able to recover in fewer than 20 iterations. In a second problem, a trajectory is determined that successfully completes a prescribed mission while harvesting energy from the flow.},
