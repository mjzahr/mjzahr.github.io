<h2>CaMOLab research</h2>
<p>
Research in the CaMOLab involves the development of novel numerical methods to
solve relevant and challenging problems that arise in mathematics, engineering,
science, or medicine. As such, it lies at the intersection of mathematics,
engineering, and computer science and requires a broad set of skills, including:
a solid foundation in mathematics, particularly advanced calculus
and numerical analysis, programming (Python, C/C++, Matlab, MPI parallelism),
familiarity with Linux system and high-performance computing, and basic
understanding of engineering physics.
</p>

<h3>Adaptive model reduction</h3>
<p>
 This project involves the development and implementation of new, adaptive
 reduced-order model methods for drastically reducing the computational
 cost of solving partial differential equations. The new method will be
 a hybrid between traditional model reduction methods that use basis
 functions with global support and efficiently enriched with locally supported
 basis functions, e.g., such as those used in finite element methods.
 For background information, see
 <a href="./research-projects-trammo.html">project page 1</a> or
 <a href="./research-projects-locrom.html">project page 2</a>
 and references therein. For additional information, email Dr. Zahr.
 Relevant background: coding experience in C/C++ and Python, familiarity
                      with numerical methods for solving PDEs, e.g.,
                      finite element methods, and familiarity with
                      projection-based reduced-order models.
 Openings: Undergraduate students, graduate students.
</p>

<h3>High-order shock tracking for high-speed flow and combustion</h3>
<p>
 This project involves the development and implementation of high-order
 numerical methods for resolving shock waves and other discontinuities
 (both stationary and moving discontinuities) in hyperbolic conservation laws.
 The motivating applications are high-speed flow (transonic, supersonic, and
 hypersonic flow around aircraft) and combustion. For background information,
 see <a href="./research-projects-shktrk.html">project page</a>
 and references therein. For additional information, email Dr. Zahr.
 Relevant background: coding experience in C/C++ and Python, familiarity
                      with numerical methods for solving PDEs, e.g.,
                      finite element methods, and familiarity with numerical
                      optimization (nonlinear, constrained).
 Openings: Undergraduate students, graduate students.
</p>

<h3>Optimization and computational fluid dynamics
    for superresolution MR images</h3>
<p>
 This project involves the development and implementation of high-order
 numerical methods for solving biological flow and optimization-based
 data assimilation to improve the computational model using MRI data
 from clinical collaborators. This project will involve the development
 of a computational pipeline that begins with a 4D flow MR image (clinical
 data) and returns a computational fluid dynamics 4D flow solution that
 agrees with the data. This will involve segmentation and meshing using
 standard tools and implementation of new numerical methods for the
 computational fluid dynamics simulation and data assimilation.
 We will be working with real clinical data from patients and the
 method/software will be used in practice. For background information, see
 <a href="./research-projects-dgopt.html">project page</a>
 and references therein. For additional information, email Dr. Zahr.
 Relevant background: coding experience in C/C++ and Python, familiarity
                      with numerical methods for solving PDEs, e.g.,
                      finite element methods, familiarity with numerical
                      optimization (nonlinear, constrained) and time-dependent
                      PDE-constrained optimization (sensitivity, adjoint
                      methods).
 Openings: Undergraduate students, graduate students.
</p>

<h3>High-order and reduced-order methods for topological optimization</h3>
<p>
 This project has two distinct directions that involve the development of
 new numerical methods for topological optimization for optimal design of
 products that will be printed using additive manufacturing tools. The
 first direction will develop high-order methods for topological
 optimization to sharply represent the interface and accurately approximate
 the PDE solution. The second direction will develop adaptive reduced-order
 models to substantially reduce cost of topological optimization for fast
 prototyping and quick turnaround times in the manufacturing pipeline.
 For additional information, email Dr. Zahr.
